# 📒 Coding Journal

## About
This repository is my personal coding journal, where I document solutions to programming challenges from platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, and others. It serves as both a practice ground and a record of my problem-solving journey.

## Goals
- Strengthen skills in data structures and algorithms
- Practice Python, SQL, and other languages through real problems
- Build a reference archive for revisiting concepts
- Track progress and growth in competitive programming

## Contents
- Problem Solutions: Organized by platform and topic
- Notes & Explanations: Key insights and approaches for each problem
- Multiple Approaches: When possible, I include alternative solutions (brute force vs optimized)

## Platforms Covered
- LeetCode
- HackerRank
- DataLemur
- Other coding challenge sites

## How to Use
- Browse solutions by folder or topic
- Read explanations to understand the thought process
- Use as a reference for learning and interview preparation
